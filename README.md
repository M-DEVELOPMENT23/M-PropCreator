Welcome to the fivem in-game item creator by M-DEVELOPMENT

# WHAT IS THIS

This script is a simple script which you can use on your server to place objects on all the sides you want on your server without having to configure it with lines of code, using the command that you can configure from Config.lua from the menu you can choose between two options
- Create a prop
- Delete prop

When choosing the first option, an input will appear in which you will have to enter the name of a valid object model, otherwise it will not appear. Once you have placed the name of the object in input, you can simply configure the position and rotation of the object from the game. without having to modify anything, once you finish placing the object where you want you just have to press ESC and the object will be saved in the database and every time the script is restarted the object will appear in that position.

When you choose the second option, a menu will appear with all the objects previously created and saved in the database. There you will be able to see all the information such as the model of the object, coordinates and rotation. If you want to delete an object, you will simply have to click on it. element you want to delete and it will be automatically deleted from the database and the game at the same time
